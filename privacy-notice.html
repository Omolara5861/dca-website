            we collect certain data including which courses, projects and tasks
            you’ve started and completed; course purchases; subscriptions;
            course certificates; your exchanges with trainers, and other
            students; and essays, answers to questions, and other items

            store course content that may contain data about you.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Trainer Payment Data</strong> If you are a trainer, you can
            link your PayPal or other payment account to the Services to receive
            payments. When you link a payment account, we collect and use
            certain information, including your payment account email address,
            account ID, physical address, or other data necessary for us to send
            payments to your account. In order to comply with applicable laws,
            we also work with trusted third parties who collect tax information
            as legally required. This tax information may include residency
            information, tax identification numbers, biographical information,
            and other personal information necessary for taxation purposes. For
            security, Digital Careers Academy does not collect or store
            sensitive bank account information. The collection, use, and
            disclosure of your payment, billing, and taxation data is subject to
            the privacy policy and other terms of your payment account provider.

          <p>
            <strong>Data About Your Accounts on Other Services</strong> We may
            obtain certain information through your social media or other online
            accounts if they are connected to your Digital Careers Academy
            account. If you login to Digital Careers Academy via Facebook or
            another third-party platform or service, we ask for your permission
            to access certain information about that other account. For example,
            depending on the platform or service we may collect your name,
            profile picture, account ID number, login email address, location,
            physical location of your access devices, gender, birthday, and list
            of friends or contacts. Those platforms and services make
            information available to us through their APIs. The information we
            receive depends on what information you (via your privacy settings)
            or the platform or service decide to give us. If you access or use
            our Services through a third-party platform or service, or click on
            any third-party links, the collection, use, and sharing of your data
            will also be subject to the privacy policies and other agreements of
            that third party.

          <p>
            <strong>Sweepstakes, Promotions, and Surveys</strong> We may invite
            you to complete a survey or participate in a promotion (like a
            contest, sweepstakes, or challenge), either through the Services or
            a third-party platform. If you participate, we will collect and
            store the data you provide as part of participating, such as your
            name, email address, postal address, date of birth, or phone number.
            That data is subject to this Privacy Notice unless otherwise stated
            in the official rules of the promotion or in another privacy policy.
            The data collected will be used to administer the promotion or
            survey, including for notifying winners and distributing rewards. To
            receive a reward, you may be required to allow us to post some of
            your information publicly (like on a winner’s page). Where we use a
            third-party platform to administer a survey or promotion, the third
            party’s privacy policy will apply.

            We use tools like cookies, web beacons, and similar tracking

            <strong>2.1 Cookies and Data Collection Tools</strong> We use
            cookies, which are small text files stored by your browser, to
            collect, store, and share data about your activities across
            websites, including on Digital Careers Academy. They allow us to
            remember things about your visits to Digital Careers Academy, like
            your preferred language, and to make the site easier to use. To

            Digital Careers Academy and service providers acting on our behalf
            (like Google Analytics and third-party advertisers) use server log
            files and automated data collection tools like cookies, tags,
            scripts, customized links, device or browser fingerprints, and web
            beacons (together, “Data Collection Tools“) when you access and use
            the Services. These Data Collection Tools automatically track and
            collect certain System Data and Usage Data (as detailed in Section
            1) when you use the Services. In some cases, we tie data gathered
            through those Data Collection Tools to other data that we collect as
            described in this Privacy Notice.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>2.2 Why We Use Data Collection Tools</strong>
            Digital Careers Academy uses the following types of Data Collection
            Tools for the purposes described:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Strictly Necessary: These Data Collection Tools enable you to
              access the site, provide basic functionality (like logging in or
              enrolling in courses), secure the site, protect against fraudulent
              logins, and detect and prevent abuse or unauthorized use of your
              account. These are required for the Services to work properly, so
              if you disable them, parts of the site will break or be
              unavailable.
            </li>
            <li>
              Functional: These Data Collection Tools remember data about your
              browser and your preferences, provide additional site
              functionality, customize content to be more relevant to you, and
              remember settings affecting the appearance and behavior of the
              Services (like your preferred language or volume level for video
              playback).
            </li>
            <li>
              Performance: These Data Collection Tools help measure and improve
              the Services by providing usage and performance data, visit
              counts, traffic sources, or where an application was downloaded
              from. These tools can help us test different versions of Digital
              Careers Academy to see which features or content users prefer and
              determine which email messages are opened
            </li>
            <li>
              Advertising: These Data Collection Tools are used to deliver
              relevant ads (on the site and/or other sites) based on things we
              know about you like your Usage and System Data (as detailed in
              Section 1), and things that the ad service providers know about
              you based on their tracking data. The ads can be based on your
              recent activity or activity over time and across other sites and
              services. To help deliver tailored advertising, we may provide
              these service providers with a hashed, anonymized version of your
              email address (in a non-human-readable form) and content that you
              share publicly on the Services.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Social Media: </strong> These Data Collection Tools enable
              social media functionality, like sharing content with friends and
              networks. These cookies may track a user or device across other
              sites and build a profile of user interests for targeted
              advertising purposes.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You can set your web browser to alert you about attempts to place
            cookies on your computer, limit the types of cookies you allow, or
            refuse cookies altogether. If you do, you may not be able to use
            some or all features of the Services, and your experience may be
            different or less functional. To learn more about managing Data
            Collection Tools, refer to Section 6.1 (Your Choices About the Use
            of Your Data) below.

          <p class="font-bold mt-5">3. What We Use Your Data For</p>
          <p>
            We only process data for specified purposes and if it is justified
            in accordance with data-protection law. The table below lists the
            various purposes for which we process personal data and the
            corresponding justification for it. Some processing of your personal
            data is justified on the basis of contractual necessity. In general,
            this applies to personal data you provide to us upon subscription to
            manage your account and monitor academic performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            We use your data to do things like provide our services, communicate
            with you, troubleshoot issues, secure against fraud and abuse,
            improve and update our services, analyse how people use our
            services, serve personalized advertising, and as required by law or
            necessary for safety and integrity. Without that information, we
            would be unable to provide you with your chosen academic programme
            and related support services.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you engage in our programs but do not complete or procure a
            subscription, we will retain your personal data in line with our
            retention schedules for statistical and audit purposes or in the
            event of a complaint or an appeal.

          <p>
            We share certain data about you with instructors, other students,
            companies performing services for us, Digital Careers Academy
            affiliates, our business partners, analytics and data enrichment
            providers, your social media providers, companies helping us run
            promotions and surveys, and advertising companies who help us
            promote our Services. We may also share your data as needed for
            security, legal compliance, or as part of a corporate restructuring.
            Lastly, we can share data in other ways if it is aggregated or
            de-identified or if we get your consent.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may share your data with third parties under the following
            circumstances or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              With Your Instructors: We share data that we have about you
              (except your email address) with instructors or teaching
              assistants for courses you enrol in or request information about,
              so they can improve their courses for you and other students. This
              data may include things like your city, country, browser language,
              operating system, device settings, the site that brought you to
              Digital Careers Academy, and your activities on Digital Careers
              Academy. If we collect additional data about you (like age or
              gender), we may share that too. We will not share your email
              address with instructors or teaching assistants. We also enable
              our instructors to implement Google Analytics on their course
              pages to track sources of traffic to their courses and optimize
              their course pages.
            </li>
            <li>
              With Other Students and Instructors: Depending on your settings,
              your shared content and profile data may be publicly viewable,
              including to other students and instructors. If you ask a question
              to an instructor or teaching assistant, your information
              (including your name) may also be publicly viewable by other users
              depending on your settings. When you collaborate and work on
              projects with other students, they will be able to see your data.
              Your data will also be viewable by other students on the mobile
              messaging apps we use.
            </li>
            <li>
              With Service Providers, Contractors, and Agents: We share your
              data with third-party companies who perform services on our
              behalf, like payment processing, fraud and abuse prevention, data
              analysis, marketing and advertising services (including retargeted
              advertising), email and hosting services, and customer services
              and support. These service providers may access your personal data
              and are required to use it solely as we direct, to provide our
              requested service.
            </li>
            <li>
              With our Affiliates: We may share your data within our corporate
              family of companies that are related by common ownership or
              control to enable or support us in providing the Services.
            </li>
            <li>
              With Business Partners: With your consent, we may share
              information that can be used to directly contact you with third
              party business partners, such as companies that may be offering
              products or services or other opportunities that may be of
              interest to you. We have agreements with other websites and
              platforms to distribute our Services and drive traffic to Digital
              Careers Academy. Depending on your location, we may share your
              data with these partners.
            </li>
            <li>
              To Power Social Media Features: The social media features in the
              Services (like the Facebook Like button) may allow the third-party
              social media provider to collect things like your IP address and
              which page of the Services you’re visiting, and to set a cookie to
              enable the feature. Your interactions with these features are
              governed by the third-party company’s privacy policy.
            </li>
            <li>
              To Administer Promotions and Surveys: We may share your data as
              necessary to administer, market, or sponsor promotions and surveys
              you choose to participate in, as required by applicable law (like
              to provide a winners list or make required filings), or in
              accordance with the rules of the promotion or survey.
            </li>
            <li>
              For Advertising: If we decide to use an advertising-supported
              revenue model in the future, we may use and share certain System
              Data and Usage Data with third-party advertisers and networks to
              show general demographic and preference information among our
              users. We may also allow advertisers to collect System Data
              through Data Collection Tools (as detailed in Section 2.1), to use
              this data to offer you targeted ad delivery to personalize your
              user experience (through behavioural advertising), and to
              undertake web analytics. Advertisers may also share with us the
              data they collect about you. To learn more or opt out from
              participating ad networks’ behavioural advertising, see Section
              6.1 (Your Choices About the Use of Your Data) below. Note that if
              you opt out, you’ll continue to be served generic ads.
            </li>
            <li>
              For Security and Legal Compliance: We may disclose your data to
              third parties if we (in our sole discretion) have a good faith
              belief that the disclosure is:

              divestiture, or dissolution (including bankruptcy), or a sale of

          <p>
            We take appropriate precautions including organisational, technical,
            and physical measures to help safeguard against accidental or
            unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, and unauthorised disclosure
            of, or access to, the Personal Data we process or use. We limit
            access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors
            and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will
            only process your personal data on our instructions and they are
            subject to a duty of confidentiality. We have put in place
            procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will
            notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are
            legally required to do so.
          </p>
          <p>
            While we follow generally accepted standards to protect Personal

            section, above) or as long as required to fulfil our legal
            obligations. We determine the appropriate retention period for
            Personal Data on the basis of the amount, nature, and sensitivity of
            the Personal Data being processed, the potential risk of harm from
            unauthorised use or disclosure of the Personal Data, whether we can
            achieve the purposes of the processing through other means, and on
            the basis of applicable legal requirements (such as applicable
            statutes of limitation).

          <p>
            After expiry of the applicable retention periods, your Personal Data

            technical reasons, to delete entirely from our systems, we will
            implement appropriate measures to prevent any further use of such
            data.
